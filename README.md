**Assignment Brief**

Design and implement a Question Paper Generator application

<aside>
💡 `{“What is the speed of light”, “Physics”, “Waves”, “Easy”, 5}`

</aside>

The Question paper Generator should look for questions in the Question Store and then generate the question paper based on the total marks and the distribution of marks based on *Difficulty*

**Example**

Assume the below requirement for a question paper:

> (100 marks, Difficulty, {20% Easy, 50% Medium, 30% Hard })
> 

The problem statement here is that you need to generate a question paper of 100 marks total of which 20% (ie, 20 marks) worth of questions should have the *Difficulty*=Easy, 50% having *Difficulty*=Medium and 30% having *Difficulty*=Hard
